🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the web application
CSS3	Responsive design and styling
JavaScript	Logic, API integration, DOM handling
OpenWeatherMap API	External weather data source

📦 How It Works
The user enters a city name in the input field.
Upon clicking the "Get Weather" button, an API call is made to fetch weather data.
The application displays:
City name
Current temperature in Celsius
Weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)
If the city is not found, an error message is shown instead of the weather info.
